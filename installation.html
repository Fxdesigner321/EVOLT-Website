        <h1>Choosing and installing a charging station</h1>
        <p>Whether you already drive an electric vehicle (EV) or are thinking of getting one, charging plays a critical role in driving an EV. Learn more about the available charging options and get help with choosing and installing the right charging station for your home.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are three types of charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs): Level 1, Level 2 and Direct Current (DC).</p>

        <h5>Level 1 Charging Station</h5>
        <p>Every new EV is sold with a Level 1 charging station. It can be plugged into a standard household 110-volt grounded wall outlet and usually requires no upgrade to your utility panel. A Level 1 charging station will deliver about 5 miles per hour of charge.
            <br>
            <br>
            This ready-to-go option might be right if you have a short commute, drive a plug-in hybrid such as the Kia Niro Plug-in Hybrid, are offered workplace charging, or if you’re able to charge your vehicle for 8 or more hours each night.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Level 2 Charging Station</h5>
            <p>Level 2 charging stations are four times faster than Level 1 and can provide about 25 miles per hour of charge. Level 2 stations require a professionally installed 240-volt outlet on a dedicated circuit. If you’d like one installed in your home, contact a licensed electrician to get an estimate and to determine if a permit is required.
                <br>
                <br>
                Level 2 might be the right choice if you drive a battery EV such as a Tesla Model 3, as these cars have larger batteries that require longer charging times. Drivers with longer commutes or who want a faster charge or a longer electric driving range should also consider choosing a Level 2 charging station.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h5>Charging on the go</h5>
                <p>If your vehicle supports them, look for publicly available DC fast chargers when you’re on the road. These high-power stations can charge a battery to 80 percent of capacity in 30 minutes or less. Check with your manufacturer for more information on DC fast charging for your EV.</p>

        <h5>Discussing installation with your property manager.
        </h5>
        <p>California law requires property owners to allow tenants to install a residential charging station. Tenants cannot be denied a request to install a residential charging station if the tenant pays for the installation, maintenance, insurance and removal of the charging station. However, there are certain residential rental conditions where this law does not apply. For example, if there are already EV charging stations for 10 percent or more of the designated parking spaces for renters, the law does not apply. </p>
